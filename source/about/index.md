During the wondrous day, Cittadini Perlulivo had been founded since 2016 by the most passionate blogger team from among various background. It had been signed that the blogger wants to remain anonymous until today. The purpose of developing this blog is to share the thought from our blogger regarding people's life routine as well as a recent trend to be updated. 

There will be more thoughts, idea, interests and etc to share around the world. We as a team will keep you entertained with our feeds until resisting us is hard for you. The recommendation, tips, advice and more are based on facts and cooperation from the reliable sources that we collected. Any mistake comes from us and we fix it in the meantime for you.

Our goal is to entertain as many human being as possible.
