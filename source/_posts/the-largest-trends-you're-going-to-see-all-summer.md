With regards to summer bags, our minds immediately think about straw totes. All of the customers we asked still approve of the seaside trend and do not see it waning any time in the future.

"A utilitarian theme and dose of practicality is welcome for summer time, " said Aiken. These lightweight layers are perfect for hot days that need coverage from the dangerous rays. She suggests "linens, khaki, along with the cargo pant and Bermuda shorts, [which] exemplify this pattern. " You heard it hear 1st: cargo pants are back. If separates aren't your point, von der Goltz said "the boiler suit takes on into this theme and is the ultimate one- step dressing option. It is so efficient, comfortable, awesome and stylish. "

#### Square Toe

Regarding to both Scafer and Aiken, it is time to square up with square-toed sneakers. "The clean, geometric forms make the shoe design modern, " stated Aiken.
