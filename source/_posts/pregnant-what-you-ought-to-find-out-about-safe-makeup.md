The FDA has little authority to modify cosmetics and personal care products. That means women in the US have to do their unique research into what's safe, and what substances might be associated with malignancy, allergies, and reproductive problems. Paying attention is particularly significant during pregnancy, a period of rapid expansion for your fetus.  If you just lately got a great pregnancy test, you have to figure out which cosmetics you can keep applying, and what should be tossed. We’re right here to greatly help. Read on to determine what make-up is safe for women that are pregnant - and how you may easily find it, either on the web, at the drugstore, or in your existing stash.

#### What’s at Risk?

Exposing your developing baby to potentially-toxic chemical substances carries risks designed for your child as they get older. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists warns that prenatal contact with toxic environmental brokers is associated with cancer and reproductive concerns later in lifestyle. Such exposure may also result in low birth excess weight and preterm birth.

In its set of 10 tricks for a less toxic pregnant state, the buyer advocacy nonprofit Environmental Working Group (EWG) lists “choose better body maintenance systems” alongside advice like “don’t smoke cigarettes” and “go organic.” If you’re serious about having a wholesome pregnancy - and a healthy child - you need to look into the ingredient list on your cosmetics. When I acquired pregnant in February 2017, I did so just that. I’m pleased to say I came across some helpful tools and shortcuts to lessen the risk without too much effort.

#### Ingredients to Avoid

Endocrine disruptors - chemical compounds that interfere with our body’s typical hormone function - are actually the main chemicals to avoid when you’re pregnant. EWG puts along its Dirty Dozen set of endocrine disruptors, and unfortunately, many of these are found in cosmetic products.

When you’re pregnant, choose fragrance-free products.

Often,  makes categorize endocrine disruptors like phthalates less than “fragrance” or “parfum” in labels. When you’re pregnant, choose fragrance-free products once you can. And skip your signature scent. It could make you nauseated, anyway.

Furthermore to endocrine disruptors, avoid vitamin A. Research implies that it could lead to birth defects. Same complements skin-lightening products.  This is a complete list of what to avoid:

- Retinyl palmitate and Retinol (vitamin A)
- Phthalates
- Parabens
- Dibutyl phthalate
- Triclosan
- BP-3
- Bisphenol A (BPA)
- BHA and BHT
- Dioxin
- Oxybenzone
- Ethanolamines (MEA/DEA/TEA)
- Diazolidinyl urea
- Phenylmercuric salts, acetate, nitrate
- Hydroquinone or glutathione
- Fragrance/parfum

#### Helpful Tools to Check on Your Own Makeup

When you could memorize the above list, that’s not practical. Here are a few tools to create it easier to look for and evaluate the cosmetic you already have.

Search EWG’s Skindeep Database to evaluate the safety of particular products.

- EWG Skindeep Database: Searching over 74,301 items to discover how they rank from 1 (low hazard) to 10 (hazardous).  This is a terrific way to check if your existing products remain safe to use while pregnant. I as well prefer to simply Google: “Product name EWG” to find the same results.
- EWG Build Your Own Statement Tool: If something isn't already in EWG’s data source, you may enter the ingredients you to ultimately get a ranking employing this tool.

If you’re pregnant, you can create some easy swaps instantly - and it will pay off. A study from UC Berkeley discovered that when teenage young girls went just three times without using goods with endocrine disruptors, their bodies responded. By simply reading labels and applying lower chemical products, these young girls lowered contact with these chemicals. You can do the same.

To get you started, here are several of the best safe swaps I made while pregnant, after researching items on EWG:

Being pregnant introduced me to fresh safe aesthetic brands, too. I’m even now using them today because the risk connected with toxic substances doesn’t end after you give birth. You might like to check them out:

- RMS Wonder: With beautiful packaging and goods that fill multiple necessities, you can’t fail with RMS Beauty, offered by Credo.
- Tata Harper: Tata Harper was motivated to understand about safe personal care things after her stepfather was identified as having cancer tumor. She created her private line of high-end skincare and make-up, available at Credo.

Pregnancy gave me personally the motivation I needed to tidy up my cosmetics. I will reap the huge benefits for the others of my life. Therefore will my daughter.
