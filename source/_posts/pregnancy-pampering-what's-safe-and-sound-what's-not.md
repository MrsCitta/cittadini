<h3>Head of hair coloring, teeth whitening, manicures, pedicures: What's safe and sound to timetable -- and what to skip?</h3>

Nothing takes the border off a good stressy, exhausting, I-hate-my-cankles kinda day time such as a little preggo primping. But you've most likely heard some scary rumors -- wild hair dye triggers birth defects, pedicures result in labor -- that may perhaps you have thinking twice about your next spa program. What's urban legend and what's fact? "There are so many myths about what's unsafe; it's hard to know very well what to believe," says Karen Boyle, MD, an assistant professor of urology, obstetrics, and gynecology at Johns Hopkins Hospital (and who's 34 weeks along with herself). Here's the myth-busting real truth about booking that rubdown, mani-pedi, and more.

#### Hair Dye

Which means you weren't born with those sun-kissed highlights? Pregnancy does not have to out your little secret. "There are a great number of chemicals found in hair dye, but no well-designed research have found any immediate link to birth defects or childhood cancers," says Richard Beigi, MD, an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of Pittsburg INFIRMARY. "While you don't desire to be exposed frequently, dyeing your hair a few times is unlikely to become a major problem." To be on the safe area, wait till the second or third trimester when almost all of the baby's major organs have finished growing, or choose highlights over single-method color. Since highlights aren't applied right to the scalp, the chemical substances are significantly less inclined to enter your bloodstream.

Important thing: Safe to schedule, but wait until trimesters 2 and 3.

#### Massage

"Massage is an excellent element during pregnancy," says Boyle. "It can help soothe tension, improve circulation, and convenience pains and aches, but it is important that the therapist understand pregnancy body improvements." If you want to lie on your belly, search for spas that provide special cut-out tables, usually, you'll likely be working for you. Susceptible to nausea? Fess up. Your therapist may choose to use unscented oil (it's less inclined to trigger a bath room run). Lastly, look out for this reddish flag: Places that want a doctor's note. It may be a sign they're not comfortable handling pregnant women.

Bottom line: Safe and sound to schedule in virtually any trimester.

#### Teeth Whitening

If you're thinking about brightening your grin, have a pregnant pause. "Because of the insufficient available subjects, pearly whites whitening hasn't been studied for safeness during pregnancy, so oral scientists do not know if whitening is safe or unsafe for women that are pregnant," says Mickey Bernstein, DDS, president-elect of the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry. "Since it's an elective treatment, it really is logical just to hang on until after delivery." Also, your gums may be more very sensitive and prone to bleeding because of hormonal shifts, and for a few women, whitening may additional irritate these hypersensitive areas.

Bottom line: Skip it.

#### Mani-Pedi

Hands down, the professionals we talked to all or any felt that mani-pedis are actually totally okay for preggos. "Your fingernails are growing and getting stronger now, so make the most," says Boyle. Though polish will contain trace amounts of harsh chemical substances, they're certainly not absorbed by your nail beds and also have never been associated with birth defects in babies, she says. A likelier difficulty: Nausea, if the salon's not well-ventilated. "Some of these fumes are pretty good, so ask to be seated by the entranceway or a window if you get queasy easily," she advises.

Bottom line: Safe and sound to schedule in virtually any trimester.

#### Hot Tubs, Steam Rooms & Saunas

If taking a dip relaxes you, miss the Jacuzzi and dunk your bump in a (warm, not super-hot) bathtub instead. "We know increased core heat range is associated with birth defects, specifically in the initial trimester," says Susan Hollander, CNM and ob-gyn nurse-practitioner. Most scorching tubs are often over 100 degrees, plus you're usually entirely submerged from the neck down. "But baths aren't as scorching, to begin with, and at least your arms, knees, and shoulders will be sticking out, so your overall temperatures doesn't climb to those risky levels." Avoid steam areas and saunas too -- the surplus heat and steam may also cause you to more wobbly than usual, as well as your balance isn't specifically what it was pre-pg.

Important thing: Skip it.

#### Facial

Wondering what happened compared to that so-named pregnant glow everyone discusses? There's no approach to predict how your skin layer will change over these nine a few months, and a facial could be a great approach to greatly help adjust to differences in texture and moisture, says Boyle. "However your complexion may come to be far more sensitive now, and that means you absolutely want to skip tough peels and microdermabrasion." As with massage, ensure that your aesthetician knows if you have any important smell aversions. As soon as you're past the primary trimester, ask to become propped up with pillows so you're not lying toned on your own back -- this posture can sluggish circulation and make you feel dizzy.

Bottom line: Safe to schedule if you skip tough peels and microdermabrasion. As well, ask to end up being propped up in trimesters 2 and 3.

#### Tanning Beds

This should be on your own no-no list already, however in case it isn't, take an extended break out of this naughty habit. If epidermis cancer isn't enough of a reason in order to avoid tanning booths, powerful UV exposure could also accelerate skin discoloration during pregnancy. You may experience some discoloration during pregnancy normally (because of all those many hormone changes) but why generate it worse, correct? And it gets really hot under those lights too, that you already know can be dangerous for your baby. If you are craving some sunshine, in that case step outside for just a little natural light -- slathered in sunscreen (at least SPF 15), of course.

Important thing: Skip it.

#### Waxing

Whether you intend to sneak in a program before you jet-collection off on your babymoon or want to make sure everything's looking good straight down there for D-day, waxing while expecting is very fine -- if you are used to it. "Very intense pain -- especially past due in pregnancy -- can prompt contractions, which is not good if you are not yet past 37 weeks," says Lillian Schapiro, MD, an Atlanta-established ob-gyn. "THEREFORE I certainly would not e book a Brazilian for the first time if you've never really had one before." Another FYI: Your sensitive skin may also be more prone to irritation, so you may need to pencil in your appointment a good working day or two before you plan to hit the beach.

Important thing: Safe to schedule on trimesters 1 and 2. Know your pain tolerance for trimester 3!

#### Gel Manicure

It's tempting going to the salon for a fairly, long-lasting pick-me-up, but hold it, sister: The compounds in gel formulas will be potentially toxic to you and Baby, says Macrene Alexiades-Armenakas, M.D., a dermatologist in New York City. Gel polishes won't seep through the nail itself but could possibly be absorbed through your nail. "And the offer breaker, whether you're pregnant or not, may be the ultraviolet lamp employed to set the gel," Alexiades-Armenakas says-the ultraviolet rays could cause hyperpigmentation and lines and wrinkles, not forgetting cancerous cells, on your own hands. To remain and your peanut safe, decide on a standard mani and select your polish properly. "Stay away from colors containing dibutyl phthalate, or DBP, toluene, and formaldehyde," says NEW YORK dermatologist Anne Chapas, M.D. (Chanel, Essie, and OPI are free from all three.) If it is time to dried out your digits, decide on a enthusiast with the UV light switched off.

Bottom line: Just don't.

#### Dermal Fillers

Hold off upon a lip injection or wrinkle smoother until following your baby arrives since dermal fillers haven’t been tested or approved for make use of during pregnancy.

#### Getting a Tattoo

If you inject something like ink into your skin, it ups the chance of a epidermis infection, says Mary Claire Haver, M.D., assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at The University of Texas at Galveston. You could also receive HIV or hepatitis B or C from needles. And there’s little research on the effects of pores and skin dyes on a growing fetus.

#### Body Piercing

Together with the needle challenges, obtaining pierced when the top area of your skin layer is expanding isn’t a good idea. “You have a greater threat of contamination if a piercing hole widens, and the stretching can keep it from restoration correctly,” says Dr. Haver. “The majority of my patients wrap up removing navel piercings about halfway through the pregnancy if they commence to protrude and get on clothing.”
