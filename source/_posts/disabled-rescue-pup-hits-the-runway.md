#### Effie’s Rescue

Living in a plastic bin inside of a Fort Well worth garage, Effie was covered in urine burns and excruciating pain. Due to a spinal crush injury Effie was unable to move the lower half of her body. Monica Brown, the Special Needs Coordinator at ASR, experienced by no means met a paralyzed puppy before Effie and after seeing Effie’s living conditions, she knew that she wasn’t leaving without her and she would do anything to get Effie mobile again. Falling in love, Monica decided then and there that she would foster Effie herself.

#### From Paralyzed to Walkin’ the Runway

After undergoing spinal surgery and recovery, Monica was concerned about getting Effie moving too quickly. Luckily, she experienced Jason Parker from the Gunnar’s Wheels Basis cheering her on. Jason knew that the sooner Effie was in her Walkin’ Wheels Wheelchair the more successful her recovery process would be. Jason encouraged Monica to get Effie on her feet as soon as possible and reassured her that Effie would never have to worry about outgrowing her wheelchair since Gunnar’s Wheels would gift her with a wheelchair for life. Her life was forever changed when she was gifted her Walkin’ Wheels wheelchair, giving her the hard- earned second chance at life she so deserves. Monica is amazed by Effie’s progress, and how far she has come in such a short period of time.

“Effie can move more now and even wagged her tail for the first time a few weeks ago, and we certainly wouldn’t be walking a huge fashion show without her wheels”.
